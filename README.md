Hello Friends

This is a freecodecamp project from the track 'Frontend libraries'
Built with React and some css.
<hr/>

To initialize the project, 'npx create-react-app' was used.

The project in itself is a simple one page app that displays random quotes from a list and changes some colors and element sizes when quotes change.
