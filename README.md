Hello Friends

This is a freecodecamp project from the track 'Frontend libraries'
Built with React and some css. 
\n'npx create-react-app' was used to initialize.
<hr/>

The project in itself is a simple one page app that displays random quotes from a list and changes some colors and element sizes when quotes change.
